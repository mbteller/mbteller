Hi, I'm @mbteller (Michael)
I am currently a professional full stack developer working primarily with PERL and Python/Django backends.  
At the moment I am looking to contribute to some of the tools that I use daily.  But I am also interested in visual/game programming.
I can be reached here at github for now.
